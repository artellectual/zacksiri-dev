The landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) is evolving rapidly, with powerful and open models being released at an unprecedented pace. As these technologies advance, so does the potential to integrate them into our existing systems. Traditionally, we've built systems with distinct layers such as the Application layer and Data Persistence layer.

In this post, I'll guide you through the process of integrating LLMs into your systems. Having recently embarked on building my first LLM-native system, I'm excited to share some practical methods for incorporating these models into your workflows.

By the end of this video, you'll have a clear understanding of how to:

1. **Identify** suitable use cases for LLMs within your existing systems.
2. **Select** the right LLM for your specific needs.
3. **Integrate** LLMs with your current architecture seamlessly.
4. **Leverage** the unique capabilities of LLMs to enhance your system's functionality.
Let's dive in and explore the future of intelligent, language-driven systems together!

For the following post I will be using [ï»¿TMDB OpenAPI](https://developer.themoviedb.org/openapi) as a case study.

## Integrating LLMs into System Architecture

Imagine having a powerful assistant embedded within your system, ready to tackle tasks on demand. That's the potential of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into your systems. With LLMs, you can offload real-time jobs without needing to program each behavior explicitly.

Traditionally, system behaviors are hard-coded and tailored to specific business problems. However, LLMs offer an opportunity to build more versatile and adaptive systems. By combining the deterministic nature of traditional programming with the probabilistic power of LLMs, developers can create hybrid systems that:

1. **Adapt** to new challenges.
2. **Generalize** solutions across various problem sets.
3. **Leverage** real-time language processing capabilities.
This approach doesn't replace traditional programming but enhances it, enabling your systems to be more intelligent and flexible.
