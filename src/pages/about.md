Hey, my name is Zack Siri, I'm currently working on a Digital Assistant Framework / Runtime. This engine will provide developers / companies with tools to build next generation conversational AI applications.

## Goals

- Generalized engine that allows developers to build any kind of digital assistant even orchestrate multiple assistants together.
- Production grade security. The engine will allow fine-grained control over access to data and resources.
- Model Agnosticism. The engine will support a wide range of models, allowing developers to choose the best fit for their use case.
- Reliable Results. It's known that LLMs can be unreliable, the engine will provide developers with the tools that improve LLM output reliability.
- Iterative Development. The engine enables developers to start with simple conversational cases and build more complex ones incrementally.
- Layered Thinking Architecture. I believe intelligence is not a single layer but a complex system of layers that work together to achieve a goal.
  - Developers will be able to use this engine to orchestrate complex workflows and build intelligent applications.
- Declarative Programming. The engine will support a declarative programming model, allowing developers to define the behavior of their applications in a declarative manner.
